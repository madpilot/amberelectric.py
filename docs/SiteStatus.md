# SiteStatus

Site status.  Pending sites are still in the process of being transferred. Note: We only include sites that have correct address details. If you expect to see a site, but don't, you may need to contact [info@amber.com.au](mailto:info@amber.com.au) to check that the address is correct.  Active sites are ones that we actively supply electricity to.  Closed sites are old sites that we no longer supply.

## Enum

* `PENDING` (value: `'pending'`)

* `ACTIVE` (value: `'active'`)

* `CLOSED` (value: `'closed'`)
